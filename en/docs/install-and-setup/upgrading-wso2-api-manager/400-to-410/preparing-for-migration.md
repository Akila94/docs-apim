This section contains the details of preparation for migration process of WSO2 API Manager 4.1.0. Go through the guidelines given below before attempting to upgrade the production environment.

!!! Attention "If you are using Analytics"
    As the on-premise analytics data cannot be migrated to the Cloud, you need to maintain the old analytics server and keep the UI running for as long as you need that data (e.g., 3 months) after migrating to the new version of analytics in WSO2 API-M 4.1.0.
