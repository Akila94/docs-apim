# Alerts Page
This page illustrates information related to business alerts issued by the system for your currently selected
 environment and organization. You can use this page as a health monitoring dashboard and make it visible to whole
  team. Using this page you can drilldown on each alert and discover possible anomalies or errors in your published
   APIs. Following sections of the document will guide you through the available widgets and how to use them to best
    effect.
    
## Prerequisites
By default, API analytics doesn't have any alerts enabled. Hence for you to use this page you should configure alerts
 and then should have API invocations which will trigger alerts.
